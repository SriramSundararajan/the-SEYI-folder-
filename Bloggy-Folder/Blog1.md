I was really excited when I received the acceptance letter to the Stanford Earth Young Investigators program this summer. At the same time, I was pretty nervous because this was going to be my first summer research internship in a big university. However, my concerns were put to ease during the first session with Dr. Noel Hiem. The program was well organized and Dr. Heim was friendly, and helpful.

I am looking forward to the internship for several reasons.

On the top of the list is the field trips to New Brighton State Beach and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, the cruise on the ship to the Marine Science Institute, and the Pinnacles overnight trip.  I am always fascinated by shells and fossils as they provide valuable clues about the marine animals, especially marine invertebrates. These field trips can provide an exciting opportunity to learn more about marine animals.

The second reason is that I will be learning to program in R, which is a powerful language used for statistical analysis of data and to draw graphs. R is much different from other languages such as Java and Pascal, and it will be a different experience to code in R.  We already have spent a week in class learning different features of R. Since it requires a different mindset to code in R, I have had my own share of hiccups, but I am improving.

The third reason is that I am inseparable from my video games during the summer. This internship gives me an opportunity to do something other than playing video games, which I donâ€™t mind. However, unlike playing video games, I learn something new every day, proceeding with the internship in the classroom with Dr. Heim and listening to guest speakers about the exciting research going on with graduate and postdoc students in the department.

All in all, I am happy to be a Stanford Earth Young Investigator spending my summer at the Stanford School of Earth Sciences.
